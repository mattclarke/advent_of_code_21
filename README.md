## Day 1
- Part 1: looping, comparing and counting.
- Part 2: loop once to collect the group of threes and then do the counting in a separate loop.
Can we do it in one loop? Yes - keep 3 in the list and do the maths.
Can we do it without popping and appending? Yes - using a sliding score.

## Day 2
- Part 1 & 2: basic string parsing and maths.

## Day 3
