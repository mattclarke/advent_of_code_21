## Day 1
- Part 1: looping, comparing and counting.
- Part 2: loop once to collect the group of threes and then do the counting in a separate loop.
Can we do it in one loop? Yes - keep 3 in the list and do the maths.
Can we do it without popping and appending? Yes - using a sliding score.

## Day 2
- Part 1 & 2: basic string parsing and maths.

## Day 3
- Part 1 & 2: binary and looping.

## Day 4
- Part 1 & 2: creating the bingo boards then looping over the numbers called then checking for a winner.
Could we reduce the amount of looping? Perhaps a 1D array? Yes, better but still pretty ugly.

## Day 5
- Part 1: simple.
- Part 2: Took me a bit of time to get the diagonals correct.
